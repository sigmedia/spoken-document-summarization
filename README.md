# Spoken Document Summarization

This repo contains example summaries for our paper "Fine Grained Spoken Document Summarization Through Text Segmentation". In this work, we proposed a framework using a long sequence transformer to generate fine grained summaries of podcast conversations.

The code and demo release is coming soon.
